        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is a search engine which finds software made for humans, and only humans. Try a search for "<a href="#http">http</a>" or "<a href="#vim">vim</a>", for example.</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>Kenneth Reitz did a great thing when he made <a href="#requests">Requests</a>: he showed us that it really is possible to build an API that is intuitive to use, but is also <i>useful</i>.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, this also convinced <a href='https://github.com/search?q="for+humans"'>a whole bunch</a> of folks that branding their software as <b>For Humansâ„¢</b> would make their libraries easier to use as well.</p>
